# With Verint call data, the Verint Extraction manager implementation has 
#   something to be desired.  It may periodically end up sending call data
#   multiple times and thus ingesting content twice. As a bit of a hack, the
#   best logic that could be determined is that if any of the jobs send back
#   too many collection folders, it is an indicator that something could be 
#   wrong.  If this is detected, no collections will be processed.
#   
#   So these settings indicate the maximum number of collection folders that
#   is considered valid. 
#       If there is no definition, or it is empty that means there is no maximum.
#       If number of collection folders for any specificed jobName is over that
#           value, this is considered a problem.
#
#   The form of the variables is:
#      MAX_<JobName>_COLLECTIONS
#
#   And should match the Verint JobName in uppercase with spaces replaced with
#      "_" char.  For example:
#
#       Mobile Export    becomes MAX_MOBILE_EXPORT_COLLECTIONS
#

MAX_OPENTRADE_COLLECTIONS=2
